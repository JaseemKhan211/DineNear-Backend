# DineNear App üçî - Restaurant Finder

DineNear is a mobile application developed as part of my 6th-semester Mobile & Web Application Development course. This app helps users find nearby restaurants, explore menus, and read reviews, all with a simple and responsive interface. Built using Flutter for the frontend, with Node.js API handling, and MongoDB for the database, DineNear brings an efficient solution for discovering local dining options. Currently under development, I‚Äôm excited to launch it soon and share it with the world! üöÄ
